Hey sup!

I'm a coffee addict front-end Web developer living in Montreal, Canada. I worked and cooperated on numerous type of Website like portfolio, media Website and educative Websites.

Furthermore, I did two front-end developer internship at <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/medias-numeriques/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CBC/Radio-Canada</a> & at <a href="https://genaiz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genaiz</a>. Today, I work full time at <a href="https://www.lecentrefranco.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centre-Franco</a> as a Front-End developer, where I was assigned to multiples projects.

While I'm not codding, I kill time by playing indies and old school game or try new cooking recipes.

I'm looking forward to speaking to you!

P.S. The one eyed fur ball is called Cinder and yes, she's adorable.
