Hey sup!

I’m a coffee addicted front-end Web developer living in Montreal, Canada. I worked and cooperated on numerous types of websites like portfolios, media websites and educational resources.

FFurthermore, I did two front-end developer internships at <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/medias-numeriques/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CBC/Radio-Canada</a> & at <a href="https://genaiz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genaiz</a>. Today, I work full time at <a href="https://www.lecentrefranco.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Le Centre-Franco</a> as a Front-End developer, where I was assigned to multiple projects.

While I’m not codding, I kill time by playing indie and old school games or by trying new cooking recipes.

I’m looking forward to speaking with you!

P.S. The one eyed fur ball is named Cinder and yes, she’s adorable.
